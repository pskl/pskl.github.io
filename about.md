Hi, my name is Pascal and I like to make things that make things.

This website is my personal little notepad and there is no specific category or theme. Articles are constantly being edited either to refine the phrasing or add more links to the stash.

* Theme base is from [Camille Diez](https://github.com/diezcami/polar-bear-theme) and slighlty customized with a bit of WebGL using [ThreeJS](threejs.org).
* The blog is powered by Jekyll (which is a [great minimalist blogging engine](https://jekyllrb.com/)) and hosted for free by [GitHub](http://github.com).
* If you want to donate BTC, please do so @ `1NVQnZo5o9pQWJGJHJTrQx5qySUKYJRPW`.

Hi, my name is Pascal and I like to make things that make things.

This website is my personal notepad and there is no specific category or theme.

* Theme base is from [Camille Diez](https://github.com/diezcami/polar-bear-theme) and slighlty customized with a bit of WebGL using [ThreeJS](threejs.org).
* The blog is powered by Jekyll (which is a [great minimalist blogging engine](https://jekyllrb.com/)) and hosted for free by [GitHub](http://github.com).
* If you want to donate BTC, please do so @ `1NVQnZo5o9pQWJGJHJTrQx5qySUKYJRPW`.

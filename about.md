This is a place where I document some stuff (mainly for myself, but if it can be of any use for other people it's even better :speak_no_evil:). Theme base is from [Camille Diez](https://github.com/diezcami/polar-bear-theme). She makes great stuff.

The blog is powered by Jekyll (which is a [great minimalist blogging engine](https://jekyllrb.com/)) and hosted for free by [GitHub](http://github.com).

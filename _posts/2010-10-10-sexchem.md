_Press release_

Berlin, Release Date: For Immediate Release

Something something about the healing power of sex.

[Robin Rapp](https://instagram.com/rapp_robin), born 1991 in Ivory Cost is studying painting at the Wei√üensee Art Academy, Berlin. He usually works on serial, large-format oil paintings. Rapp is particularly interested in the disturbing factor in a painting, which creates a state of tension and thus ambiguity on the canvas. His works are often based on collages, from which figures are torn out of their original context and repeatedly installed in another room. He also uses references from his past or childhood, imagination and memories comes together and build a new reality.

[August Zwieser](https://www.instagram.com/august_zwieser/) is an earthling of the Western Hemisphere, with 100% proletariat pumping through his veins, a monument of the working class. He is a provocation standing in the room, which zap like a remote condition non-stop by the television channels of the society.

[pskl](https://foundation.app/pskl) is essentially focused on the mutations caused by automation on the fleeting definition of the creative process, he is trying to encode art direction into custom autonomous virtual machines. Their output is based on passively repurposing internet material into new results, the greater goal being not only to summon a subjective soul into the machine realm but also to explore new methods of production that have inherent scalability properties. As such the modular properties of his practice allow us to gaze into an imminent future where the notion of artistry is constantly pushed further into abstraction: a scaled body of work striving to embrace noise, reconsidering every single error and side effect as the fundamental benefits of this approach.

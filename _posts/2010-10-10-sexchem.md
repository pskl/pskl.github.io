_Press release_

Berlin, Release Date: For Immediate Release

We all appreciate the well-being that comes from talking about the role of sex and intimacy in our lives. The overconsumption and digitalization of sex and drugs together over-stimulates our pleasure circuit. In response to this omnipresent and growing hypersexualization of society, we see the emergence of social and behavioral phenomena that aim to free themselves from social injunctions regarding gender, sexual practices and performance.

Like chemsex, a sexual practice linked to a form of identity liberation. Chemsex, a word combining "chemical" and "sex", is a minority practice associating sexual relations between several human beings with the use of drugs. Catalyzed by the anticipated impact of psychoactive substances, it is experienced for the euphoria, connection and heightened pleasure it provides but is inherently contradictory and can therefore lead to either socialization or isolation caused by sexual dissatisfaction or lack of interpersonal relationships with partners.

The exhibition "Sexchem" invites us to rethink our individual and collective relationship to sex and its different practices and representations. By questioning the reversibility and interdependence of the concept of chemistry over chemical, the common search for pleasure at its peak and the coveted intensive secretion of these jouissive molecules. And so explore the sexual multiverse and its innumerable artistic interprétations.

[Robin Rapp](https://instagram.com/rapp_robin), born 1991 in Ivory Cost is studying painting at the Weißensee Art Academy, Berlin. He usually works on serial, large-format oil paintings. Rapp is particularly interested in the disturbing factor in a painting, which creates a state of tension and thus ambiguity on the canvas. His works are often based on collages, from which figures are torn out of their original context and repeatedly installed in another room. He also uses references from his past or childhood, imagination and memories comes together and build a new reality.

[Rustcakes](https://www.instagram.com/rustcakes/) - "Working in kitchens since 2007 means there’s no place i know better. To me the process of baking is therapeutic, and I’m grateful my work allows me to be creative. My cakes are inspired mostly by nature and contemporary culture. When it comes to cake design, the stranger and more bizarre the better. All I want to do is ethical, responsible, and imaginative cake-making and to experiment with its visuality. When I have time, I use the ressources I have to bake for charities. In general my cakes are not too sweet, but still full of flavor. I also use swiss buttercream, which is less sugary. All my cakes are made with plant-based butter, so you still get the texture and taste of a classic fluffy sponge."

[August Zwieser](https://www.instagram.com/august_zwieser/) is an earthling of the Western Hemisphere, with 100% proletariat pumping through his veins, a monument of the working class. He is a provocation standing in the room, which zap like a remote condition non-stop by the television channels of the society.

[pskl](https://foundation.app/pskl) is essentially focused on the mutations caused by automation on the fleeting definition of the creative process, he is trying to encode art direction into custom autonomous virtual machines. Their output is based on passively repurposing internet material into new results, the greater goal being not only to summon a subjective soul into the machine realm but also to explore new methods of production that have inherent scalability properties. As such the modular properties of his practice allow us to gaze into an imminent future where the notion of artistry is constantly pushed further into abstraction: a scaled body of work striving to embrace noise, reconsidering every single error and side effect as the fundamental benefits of this approach.

_Press release_

Berlin, Release Date: For Immediate Release

“Good artists copy, great artists steal”. The post-pandemic subject, freshly robbed of two years of their life, witnesses increasing and banalized amounts of institutionalized theft, a global multimodal campaign acting out on all fronts: the workers being robbed of their earnings and equity, sovereign nations being violently robbed of their nation, language and culture, 6 million individuals robbed of their lives, corporate automated data-theft, monetary inflation and the advent of machine-augmented plagiarism. In spite of this chaotic zeitgeist the nascent novel production techniques announce the desacralization of art production and the birth of new incentive frameworks, fresh blood, inspiration, and revamped values breaching new creative frontiers.
The exhibition “Zapzarap” invites us to re-examine our expectations about ownership and deservingness, redefining the liminal vacuum of morality and grand theft aesthetics. It invites the viewer to step into a world of carefree self-expression, a world where traceability is pondered, one that values authentic self-expression as a means to stand out. While the possibility of an original thought is more and more scrutinized, Art has been kidnapped and the ransom is brazen authenticity!

[Robin Rapp](https://instagram.com/rapp_robin), born 1991 in Ivory Coast is studying painting at the Weißensee Art Academy, Berlin. He usually works on serial, large-format oil paintings. Rapp is particularly interested in the disturbing factor in a painting, which creates a state of tension and thus ambiguity on the canvas. His works are often based on collages, from which figures are torn out of their original context and repeatedly installed in another room. He also uses references from his past or childhood, imagination and memories comes together and build a new reality.

[Yulav](https://instagram.com/yulav) is an artist of various media, by birth from Siberia, lives and operates in Berlin. Its art takes origin from the street in its broader understanding. Yulav has worked for the street audience since 2018, still considering the outdoor surface as the best exhibition space and inspiration source. It has participated in numerous exhibitions in Russia, China, Czech Republic and had its first solo exhibition in 2020 in Berlin. The works presented at the exhibition send the viewer to the contradiction between the stormy stream of thoughts and their absence. The detailing of the canvas reaches such a scale that it is already not clear how harmoniously all these small thoughts embodied in reality. The author wonders about the necessity of detail as a whole, about the choice between the complex and the simple. Should one go into the wilderness and specify, should each detail be considered separately; or would it be more useful to renounce concretization and regard the object as something all-encompassing and extraneous.
This abstract interpretation goes back further, to a conflicting society in which a certain group of cohabitants tries to complicate things, while a second group stereotypes them. The author's reflection culminates in a moment of synchronization, a moment of harmony between contradictions. The author sees in the diversity, even the polarity of opinions and approaches - one wholesome thought that explains humanity.

[pskl](https://foundation.app/pskl) is essentially focused on the mutations caused by automation on the fleeting definition of the creative process, he is trying to encode art direction into custom autonomous virtual machines. Their output is based on passively repurposing internet material into new results, the greater goal being not only to summon a subjective soul into the machine realm but also to explore new methods of production that have inherent scalability properties. As such the modular properties of his practice allow us to gaze into an imminent future where the notion of artistry is constantly pushed further into abstraction: a scaled body of work striving to embrace noise, reconsidering every single error and side effect as the fundamental benefits of this approach.

[August Zwieser](https://www.instagram.com/august_zwieser/) is an earthling of the Western Hemisphere, with 100% proletariat pumping through his veins, a monument of the working class. He is a provocation standing in the room, which zap like a remote condition non-stop by the television channels of the society.

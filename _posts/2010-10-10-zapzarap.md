## Abstract

“Good artists copy, great artists steal”. The post-pandemic subject, freshly robbed of two years of their life, witnesses increasing and banalized amounts of institutionalized theft on all fronts: the workers being robbed of their earnings and equity, nations being violently robbed of their, language, culture and sovereignty, 6 million individuals robbed of their lives, corporate automated data-theft, monetary inflation and the advent of machine-augmented plagiarism. As new platforms and mediums develop without regulation, opportunities for theft arise alongside opportunities for other creative ventures, devices democratize access to casinos, tax havens, and canvases alike. The nascent novel production techniques announce the desacralization of art production and the birth of new incentive frameworks, fresh blood, inspiration, and revamped values breaching new creative frontiers.
The exhibition “Zapzarap” invites us to re-examine our expectations about ownership, redefining the liminal vacuum of morality and grand theft aesthetics. If ownership in a digitally-surveilled economy always comes with strings attached, can following the money reveal any connections? “Zapzarap” invites the viewer to step into a world of carefree self-expression, a world where traceability is pondered, one that values authentic self-expression as a means to stand out. While the possibility of an original thought is more and more scrutinized, art has been kidnapped and the ransom is brazen authenticity!

## Artists

### [Robin Rapp](https://instagram.com/rapp_robin)

 born 1991 in Ivory Coast is studying painting at the Weißensee Art Academy, Berlin. He usually works on serial, large-format oil paintings. Rapp is particularly interested in the disturbing factor in a painting, which creates a state of tension and thus ambiguity on the canvas. His works are often based on collages, from which figures are torn out of their original context and repeatedly installed in another room. He also uses references from his past or childhood, imagination and memories comes together and build a new reality.

### [Ximena Ferrer-Pizarro](https://instagram.com/ximenafegger/)

 lives in Berlin since 2014 (1994, Lima-Perú), studied painting at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weissensee in the class of Friederike Feldmann and at the Universidad Autónoma de México. Currently Meisterschülerin of Friederike Feldmann.

Using a compilation of stories and memories, real and invented, as a starting point, my work begins by sketching them on paper until I find the best way to capture them. Sometimes fearlessly, sometimes shyly. The next step is moving on to the canvas and painting with acrylic. Acrylic paint allows me to work fast, make mistakes and correct them quickly, which gives the paintings a fresh and spontaneous touch. Throughout the process, I decide which "mistakes" keep the story alive and decide to make them part of the composition. I choose colors that vibrate and make me feel alive,  colors that work as reminders of the messiness and innocence with which we sometimes confront life.

<img class='post-image' src="/assets/pictures/zapzarap/ximena.png">

Influenced by Latin American art in conflict with my European education, I try to reconcile myself with colonialist history in a kind of spoiled way. I create sensitive and vibrant images inspired by telenovelas’ playful and stereotypical Latin American characters. Using exaggerated, dramatic and humoristic language, I ask simple and sincere questions that attempt to humanize mistakes and social problematics. I depict intimate scenes that speak about universal themes such as the tragicomedy of a migratory process, colonial trauma and cultural heritage. In these scenes I present different imperfect and anthropomorphic characters who tell their very own micro-political stories. Lived or yet to be lived, invented or dreamt. Hard, weird and funny.

### [pskl](https://foundation.app/pskl)

is a Berlin-based automation artist essentially focused on the mutations caused by automation on the fleeting definition of the creative process, he is trying to encode art direction into custom autonomous virtual machines. Their output is based on passively repurposing internet material into new results, the greater goal being not only to summon a subjective soul into the machine realm but also to explore new methods of production that have inherent scalability properties. As such the modular properties of his practice allow us to gaze into an imminent future where the notion of artistry is constantly pushed further into abstraction: a scaled body of work striving to embrace noise, reconsidering every single error and side effect as the fundamental benefits of this approach.

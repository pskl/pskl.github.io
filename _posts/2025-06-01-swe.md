## Software is dead

### Vibe coding yourself to death

Casino-like spiral of feature iteration and deceptive behavior making the ability to make anything appealing to anyone could be damaging for most.

#### Brain sovereignity

What happens when you have to rent the ability to compute or design?

#### IDE wars schadenfreude

The paradigm shift is so big that there is no valid reason to switch to VIM/Emacs now.

### Codebase scale synthetic cognition and software architecture

### Skyrocketing code volumes

Productivity gains come at the cost of bloat. Vibe coders will generate immense amounts of features.

## Long live software

### Actual gains

#### No more reason to ship with no tests

#### No more reason not to use the right tool for the job

### Crawling out of dependency hell

### Cancelling subscriptions

### Supercharged PM mommies

## Synthesis

_Press release_

Berlin, Release Date: For Immediate Release

Rearing its ugly head once again, we are currently experiencing the vivid comeback of hyperconsumption, environmental disaster and political turmoil ironically paired with the illusion of being able to operate more or less like we did before. During lockdowns, the rise of Non Fungible Tokens increased the transactional nature of Art and furthered the global disconnect between Art and ambition; data-dadaism inflating the egos of artists and nudging them towards becoming independent businesses.
These times offer an opportunity to face our learned behaviors with fresh eyes. They ask us to decide what, if anything, was learned from forced isolation and how to integrate those lessons moving forward. But they also let us to once again  rejoice and celebrate the physical and social aspects of our craft. ‘Endorphin Delusion’ invites us to re-examine the properties of the delusions we lost and what purpose they served in the first place.

[Robin Rapp](https://instagram.com/rapp_robin), born 1991 in Ivory Cost is studying painting at the Weißensee Art Academy, Berlin.

Usually Robin works on serial, large-format oil paintings. Rapp is particularly interested in the disturbing factor in a painting, which creates a state of tension and thus ambiguity on the canvas. His works are often based on collages, from which figures are torn out of their original context and repeatedly installed in another room. He also uses references from his past or childhood, imagination and memories comes together and build a new reality.

[Yulav](https://instagram.com/yulav) is an artist of various media, by birth from Siberia, lives and operates in Berlin.Its art takes origin from the street in its broader understanding. Yulav has worked for the street audience since 2018, still considering the outdoor surface as the best exhibition space and inspiration source. It has participated in numerous exhibitions in Russia, China, Czech Republic and had its first solo exhibition in 2020 in Berlin.

[August Zwieser](https://instagram.com/fikkusrecords) is an earthling of the Western Hemisphere, with 100% proletariat pumping through his veins. He is a monument of the working class. Grown up in Germany, among earthlings who drive a funny movie, which is made of ass licking and bowing to the world of work and whose maggots are blinded by the belief that they have too little and that others would steal their world of work from them and are incapable of realizing that the plastic dream they live would never work without exploitation and discrimination. They prefer to function like robots and have no time to take care of true life tasks like rushed animals. The animal calls itself the human being, among them there are white eccentrics who represent a minority, but behave as if they were the great majority. Their immeasurable desire to absorb even more leads to the destruction of the only basis of life. In the center of their faith, there is a piece of paper that keeps this go-getting creature alive. Their gods are so-called corporations that worship this subspecies to the utmost. They have been created to keep stupid power relations and small egos with huge ego problems alive, and to humiliate, enslave and as far as possible culturally alienate the rest of these beings. Unfortunately, the behavior of the Tubab subspecies is contagious, as their gods, with coercive mechanisms and insatiable greed, push everyone towards a monotonous meritocracy. Trapped in this old spirit world, in which the old spirits should have passed away long ago, they still insist on their long outdated right to exist. He is a provocation standing in the room, which zap like a remote condition non-stop by the television channels of the society.

[pskl](https://foundation.app/pskl) is essentially focused on the mutations caused by automation on the fleeting definition of the creative process, Pascal is trying to encode art direction into custom autonomous virtual machines. Their output is based on passively repurposing internet material into new results, the greater goal being not only to summon a subjective soul into the machine realm but also to explore new methods of production that have inherent scalability properties. As such the modular properties of his practice allow us to gaze into an imminent future where the notion of artistry is constantly pushed further into abstraction: a scaled body of work striving to embrace noise, reconsidering every single error and side effect as the fundamental benefits of this approach.

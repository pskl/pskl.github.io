_Press release_

Berlin, Release Date: For Immediate Release

Rearing its ugly head once again, we are currently experiencing the vivid comeback of hyperconsumption, environmental disaster and political turmoil ironically paired with the illusion of being able to operate more or less like we did before. During lockdowns, the rise of Non Fungible Tokens increased the transactional nature of Art and furthered the global disconnect between Art and ambition; data-dadaism inflating the egos of artists and nudging them towards becoming independent businesses.
These times offer an opportunity to face our learned behaviors with fresh eyes. They ask us to decide what, if anything, was learned from forced isolation and how to integrate those lessons moving forward. But they also let us to once again  rejoice and celebrate the physical and social aspects of our craft. ‘Endorphin Delusion’ invites us to re-examine the properties of the delusions we lost and what purpose they served in the first place.

Artists: August Zwieser, pskl, more TBA

<!-- [Pascal Lamouric](https://foundation.app/pskl) is essentially focused on the mutations caused by automation on the fleeting definition of the creative process, Pascal is trying to encode art direction into custom autonomous virtual machines. Their output is based on passively repurposing internet material into new results, the greater goal being not only to summon a subjective soul into the machine realm but also to explore new methods of production that have inherent scalability properties. As such the modular properties of his practice allow us to gaze into an imminent future where the notion of artistry is constantly pushed further into abstraction: a scaled body of work striving to embrace noise, reconsidering every single error and side effect as the fundamental benefits of this approach.

## Abstract

The exhibition treats revision as revelation, where the strikethrough becomes not an erasure but a palimpsest of possibility. In an era demanding algorithmic consistency, changing one's mind becomes a creative act of defiance.

Through works bearing visible traces of their own undoing, the exhibition positions indecision as method and withdrawal as gesture. Here, the crossed-out word carries more weight than the final draft, and the artist who drops out last minute performs the ultimate creative act: refusing to perform.

## Artists

### pskl

is a Berlin-based artist focused on the mutations caused by automation of the creative process. By encoding art direction into autonomous virtual machines, their output passively repurposes internet material into new results. Striving to summon a subjective soul into the machine realm, they also explore new methods of production that have inherent properties of scalability. The modular aspects of their practice enable us to gaze into an imminent future where the notion of art production is constantly redefined: a scaled body of work striving to embrace noise, reconsidering every single error and side effect as a fundamental benefit.

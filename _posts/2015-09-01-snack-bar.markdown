I don't like to get any stuff from vending machines because it's both expensive and of shit quality.
When it comes to snack bars most people would like to go with the one that has the least calories inside but in my case I'm looking for the one that has the most calories packed inside, regardless of the actual quality of the nutrients. That is absolutely ridiculous but you can definitely know which one is going to provide the most amount of energy to your body.

When facing a vending machine you will have those choices (but you don't have acess to the kcal information) :

Snickers:    57.5 g / 278 kcal

Mars:       51 g / 229 kcal

Twix:     50 g  / 220 kcal


It also depends on a lot of other factors of course but if want to get a quick sugar boost go with the Snickers bar. Thank you.

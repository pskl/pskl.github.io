## Abstract

Health has become an intricate system of mazes where 'users' navigate a dizzying array of options, from cutting-edge data analysis to crusty esoteric practices resurrected and repackaged as products from a different time and space. "helth: its good for u" invites the visitor to cheekily scratch the surface of the ways in which we seek to optimize our well-being. The exhibition casts a critical eye on the industries that have emerged to capitalize on our collective obsession, from the rise of biometric sensors and genetic testing to the proliferation of dietary supplements, life coaching, and cosmetic enhancements. It highlights the potential pitfalls of a society in which every facet of our lives is subject to constant monitoring and improvement, where the suspicion of issues is faced with the might of the pill, the chip, the scalpel, and dialectically mediated self-diagnosis.

Falling down the rabbit hole of contemporary health, the exhibition raises questions about the blurring lines between science and influence, the role of terminally-online discourse in shaping our understanding of ourselves, and the unintended consequences of a culture seemingly built on confusion over mediation, where contradictions are both the symptom and the cure. With a curatorial approach that is both incisive and playful, it presents a timely meditation on the soothing aesthetics of mass hypochondria, the unfolding epistemological clusterfuck, and the paradoxes within our quest for optimal wellness. Seasoned clinicians, therapists, spiritual coaches, and sound healers alike recommend astute attendance for trauma healing, self-mogging, ascetic vitality, enhanced biomarkers, increased fertility and lavish longevity.

## Artists

### [Daria Chernyshova](https://www.instagram.com/intuitive.practice/)

is a visual artist based in Berlin. Intuition plays a leading role in Daria Chernyshova’s practice. The starting point of her work is an ephemeral vision seen by her inner eye. She documents these insights, supplementing them with records of emotions translated into a graphic language. The drawing process becomes a tool she uses to observe the ways in which the mind memorizes, stores, and reproduces information in reimagined form. The compositions of Intuitive Practice combine abstraction with geometric shapes and often include figurative elements referring to her personal recollections. They resemble tables, schedules, questionnaires or various containers that Chernyshova fills out during sessions of self-reflection.

### [Louis Bard](https://www.instagram.com/loup_ba/)

### [Martyna Lebryk](https://www.martynalebryk.com)

"I’m a visual artist whose work encompasses painting, sculpture and installation. My work explores ideas of social agency, power, control and failure. The artworks I create, seek to unearth the relationship between the body and the built space by operating somewhere between an image and a three-dimensional form. They ask to consider bodies within the painting and those of the visiting spectators. Thus, I propose spaces were two- and three-dimensional works interplay, where bodily shapes within the paintings, the spatiality of the walls and the installation, and the presence of the spectator all play a role in activating the artwork."

### [Le Grand Docteur Pascal](https://nft.pascal.cc)

is a Berlin-based artist focused on the mutations caused by automation of the creative process. By encoding art direction into autonomous virtual machines, their output passively repurposes internet material into new results. Striving to summon a subjective soul into the machine realm, they also explore new methods of production that have inherent properties of scalability. The modular aspects of their practice enable us to gaze into an imminent future where the notion of art production is constantly redefined: a scaled body of work striving to embrace noise, reconsidering every single error and side effect as a fundamental benefit.

### ~~[Omer Huja](https://www.instagram.com/omer_hood_ja/)~~

is a video artist from Jerusalem, Israel, has over a decade of experience mastering video production softwares. Love experimental video installations that explore the fusion of image and narrative, creating immersive visual experiences that challenge traditional storytelling.

## Abstract

With unprecedented access to information and services, the concept of health has become a labyrinthine maze where 'users' navigate a dizzying array of options, from cutting-edge data analysis to crusty esoteric practices resurrected and repackaged as products from a different time and space. The exhibition "helth: its good for u" invites the visitor to cheekily scratch the surface of the ways in which we seek to optimize our well-being. The exhibition casts a critical eye on the industries that have emerged to capitalize on our collective obsession, from the rise of biometric sensors and genetic testing to the proliferation of dietary supplements, life coaching, and cosmetic enhancements. It highlights the potential pitfalls of a society in which every facet of our lives is subject to constant monitoring and improvement, where the suspicion of issues is faced with the might of the pill, the chip, the scalpel, and dialectically mediated self-diagnosis.

As we delve deeper into the rabbit hole of contemporary health, the exhibition raises questions about the blurring lines between science and influence, the role of terminally-online discourse in shaping our understanding of ourselves, and the unintended consequences of a culture seemingly built on confusion over mediation, where contradictions are both the symptom and the cure. With a curatorial approach that is both incisive and playful, it presents a timely meditation on the soothing aesthetics of mass hypochondria, the unfolding epistemological clusterfuck, and the paradoxes within our quest for optimal wellness. Seasoned clinicians, therapists, spiritual coaches, and sound healers alike recommend astute attendance for trauma healing, self-mogging, ascetic vitality, enhanced biomarkers, and lavish longevity.

## Artists

### [Uncanny Julia](https://xemantic.com/)

is a cofounder of the [Xemantic collective](https://xemantic.com/) in Berlin which investigates Applied Philosophy in the software realm. She also works as a doctoral candidate, clinician and Machine-Learning engineer.

### [Maxime Lester](https://www.instagram.com/maximelester/)

### [pskl](https://nft.pascal.cc)

is a Berlin-based artist focused on the mutations caused by automation of the creative process. By encoding art direction into autonomous virtual machines, their output passively repurposes internet material into new results. Striving to summon a subjective soul into the machine realm, they also explore new methods of production that have inherent properties of scalability. The modular aspects of their practice enable us to gaze into an imminent future where the notion of art production is constantly redefined: a scaled body of work striving to embrace noise, reconsidering every single error and side effect as a fundamental benefit.

Ok so you have some money that you want to put aside for a rainy day? Great that's a fantastic start but now you don't exactly know what to do with it. Since 99 % of the currencies of the world are inflationary (meaning that a central authority can introduce more liquidity at any time) putting that money in a standard bank account with close to no interest would be stupid, that money needs to be put to work and earn interest on your behalf. There are several ways to do this. This article is a general introduction to global savings and doesn't take into account regional specificities and potential tax efficient situations you might encounter.

##  Investing in tangible assets

### Should you buy real estate?
Investment decisions are often clouded by psychological bias. For instance in many countries it is commonly believed that the best kind of investment a young adult can make is buy her own flat/house because its safe and that way she doesn't have to pay rent which alleviates the pains of life in a peculiar way. Well this is only true if you buy real estate in a real good up and coming area, otherwise a portfolio of securities will yield better returns in the long run.

### Should you buy gold or other rare items?

In general it is good practice to invest in what you know and value. For instance if you're a wine connoisseur speculating on wines could be a good fit for you because of the [endowment effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect) you might experience when holding it. Gold is generally a solid investment because it's rare and the value can only go up over time (unless [Asteroid mining](http://science.howstuffworks.com/asteroid-mining.htm) becomes a thing) but it's not very practical. In general this category should not be your main focus of allocation but can yield solid returns if done wisely.

## Investing in abstract assets

### The marvellous land of Indexed Funds

One basic asumption to make before diving into more details: the stock market is complex and influenced by an extremely wide array of external and internal factors which basically makes it one big computational problem. It is by design extremely difficult to intuitively anticipate market movements. Thus most human-made investment decisions will be relatively poorly made in regard to their robot counterparts. Even [Warren Buffet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett) who is probably the most successful investor of all times agrees that [actively managed funds are not worth the premium price](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/business/dealbook/buffett-asks-big-money-why-pay-high-fees.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share). This doesn't mean that actively managing securities is not something to pursue but just that's it's an incredibly difficult problem that requires heavy real-time data analysis and accurate prediction models, very few companies have been able to do it successfully and consistently (most notably [Renaissance Technologies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-21/how-renaissance-s-medallion-fund-became-finance-s-blackest-box.).
There are many organisations selling those products bare or with extra services. For instance in germany one of the leanest retailers of securities is [Flatex](http://flatex.de).

**What the fuck  is a fund?**

A fund is essentially just money from several individuals pooled together in order to generate returns collectively just because 4 % returns on 10 000 000 € is better than 4 % returns on 10 000 €. There are lots of types of funds but they can mostly be clustered in 3 categories.

| Fund Type      | Category      | Key characteristic  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Mutual    | active | Wealth manager actively invests the money. |
| Indexed    | passive      | Money is automatically following a market index. |
|Hedge | active | Mutual Fund with restricted access and fancy technology to [hedge](http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Hedging) against the market.

**What the fuck is a wealth manager ?**

A wealth manager is a human or group of humans that intensely look at Excel spreadsheets in order to devise investment strategies (securities to buy) for your money, on your behalf.

**What the fuck is an Index?**

It's a measurement of the value of a section of a market. It is meant to represent the overall trend of an aggregate of companies. For example the [S&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index) is an index. Historical evidence shows that very few active fund managers can outperform indexes.

**btw I keep hearing about ETFs, what are those?**

ETF are essentially a type of Indexed Funds with sligthly different features.

### I heard about crypto-currencies having insane yield, where can I buy some of that?

As much as indexed funds are old proven technology crypto-currencies are from a totally different world. They are  akin to currencies but not issued by any central bank of any government and are only subject to the rules of the code (written by a small group of maintainers). The whole subject is too complex to detail in this article but just know that as currencies are being issued their popularity and market capitalization (the total value of all units) tends to go up meaning the value of a single unit also tends to go up because of limited offer.

Crypto-currencies are extremely new and risky assets but they can yield extremely fruitful returns, for instance Bitcoin's price increased 180% in 2016 (which shines a lot compared to an average 4-6% on a regular portfolio). I would not recommend putting all your savings in crypto currencies no matter the amount of risk you think you can handle because this could all flatten out in a second, but on the other hand if you're looking for potentially good bets on the future this is probably one of them. Between March and June 2017, the total market capitalization (ie the amount of value put in all cryptos) has gone from 25 to 100 Billion USD. This is has raised so much interest that [Hedge Funds are quietly investing in it to better their average performance](https://news.bitcoin.com/hedge-funds-investing-bitcoin/).

I highly recommend adhering to the social, political and technical aspects of the founding principles of the blockchain. A lack of understanding can cause cognitive bias and very sub-par allocation decisions. For example Bitcoin is not just a digital currency, it's a protocol of communication. To understand where Bitcoin is located on the human timeline of groundbreaking inventions you can have a look at the following video:

<iframe class="post-video" width="560" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/l1si5ZWLgy0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If you want to go deeper in understanding how Bitcoin (and other crypto-currencies) works under the hood the book of reference is [Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388). Otherwise you can learn how Bitcoin works [with emojis](https://medium.com/@tessr/making-money-530d2bb2b8f7). This invention is extremely hard to fully grasp because it intersects both Computer Science (distributed systems, open source technologies, version control, network protocols) and Economics (free market, offer and demand, inflation, [deflation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6yn8hs/the_difference_between_inflation_and_deflation/)). A firm understanding of both renders the task less daunting.

Here is another good video that adresses legitimacy concerns which are numerous when you come to think of it for the first time:

If you have done your homework already and consider yourself informed enough and willing to invest you can head towards one of the many exchange places online where you can buy crypto tokens with fiat currency. At the time of writing of this article one of the most reliable exchange is [Kraken](http://kraken.com/).

## Diversification is :key:

<img class='post-image' src="http://pascal.cc/assets/gifs/diversify.gif">

In order to have relatively stable decent returns every year it is necessary to diversify the assets in your portfolio as much as possible according the [modern portfolio theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory). This allows you to spread the risk and make your porfolio more resilient to sudden market changes. What that means is that if you get super stacked on the passive investment side then you can allow yourself to get that nice apartment and über hipster crypto tokens portfolio which you can monitor on your phone using [Blockfolio](http://blockfolio.com/).

**Conclusion**

Diversify your portfolio and hold tangible assets and financial products in order to guarantee a certain amount of safety. When buying financial securities only buy Indexed Funds and ETF, buy early, hold, reap the fruits later. It's like growing a garden. If you are young and without too many downpayments you can consider investing in crypto-currencies which are the most high-risk/high-reward asset class that exists right now.
